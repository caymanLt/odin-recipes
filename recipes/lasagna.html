            <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 lb ground beef lean</li>
            <li>1/2 lb Italian sausage</li>
            <li>onion powder to taste</li>

            <li>1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
            <li>Brown Beef and sausage, and add onion&garlic powder</li>
            <li>Stir in the pasta sauce and simmer for 5 minutes to thicken</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, create the cheese mixture by combining 1&1/2 cups of mozzarella, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, 2 cups ricotta, 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley & a beaten egg</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
            <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting. Even 30-45 is fine too.</li>
